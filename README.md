# Smart-Street-Light-Using-LDR-Sensor
Street lights are operated manually and because of that, sometimes lights are turned on in day time also. For that i build a system which turn off the lights automatically in day time using LDR Sensor. 

I used Firebase Realtime Databse to get realtime values of sensor based on which light is turned on or off.

Libraries Used:
---------------
SoftwareSerial.h

ArduinoJson.h

Firebase.h

FirebaseArduino.h

FirebaseCloudMessaging.h

FirebaseError.h

FirebaseHttpClient.h

FirebaseObject.h

ESP8266WiFi.h
